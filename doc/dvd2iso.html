<h2 align="center">DVD Backup Script</h2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
I resisted a long time, but I finally bit the bullet and started
buying DVD's. I am a science fiction buff, and there are a lot of
classic science fiction on DVD now. But after a few weeks I noticed
that all my precious DVD's were starting to get scratched, lost,
etc. To make matters worse some of the DVD's are hard to find
anymore. So what is your average Linux stud to do? Why make backup
copies of my DVD's of course! I poked around a bit, and there are some
solutions available that I found unsatisfactory. A good site to look
at is <A HREF="http://www.vcdhelp.com/">VCDHelp.com</A> I wanted
something cheap, Linux based, easy to use, and automated. And so the
project begins! 

<H3>Issues</H3>
<P>My first consideration is the cost in money. CD writers have been
around a while, and both the drives and the media are fairly
cheap. But if you want to backup an entire movie with a CD writer
there are some trade offs. Either you end up with multiple CD's or
unsatisfactory quality. The good news is that DVD burners and media
have come down in price as well, and are just now becoming a viable
option. 100 1X DVD blanks now cost less than $100 US and the
Pioneer DVR-104 drives are now going
for less than $200 US on Ebay. Right, a DVD writer it is then.</P>
<P>The next major issue is a matter of formats. The DVD standard is a
pretty loose standard. First of all there are currently about 18 different
physical varieties with capacities ranging from 1.36 Gig to 15.90 
Gig with more on the way. By far the most common formats, thankfully, are known as DVD-5
(4.37 Gig) and DVD-9 (7.95 Gig). Now, guess which format commercial
DVD's come in, and which format your typical DVD writer writes? That's
right, most commercial DVD's are DVD-9 and most DVD writers are DVD-5. So
many DVD's have to go through a process known as transcoding to shrink
them down to fit on a DVD-5 DVD. Unless, of course, your source DVD
happens to be a DVD-5 format DVD or else you don't mind splitting the
content roughly in half.</P>  

<P>In addition to the different physical varieties there are also
different logical format varieties. There are various audio, video,
menu, subtitle, and other possibilities. For example, one or more
audio tracks in AC3, MP2, or WAV formats are allowed. The Linux
based tools for manipulating DVD data are fairly well advanced. The
problem is that, since DVD writers have only recently become an option
for the average joe, the tools to burn DVD's are not as well
advanced. In fact I found it a bit of a challenge to generate a script
that could reliably produce a DVD that would play in most set top DVD
players.</P>

<H3>The Script</H3>
<P>What I wanted was a simple Perl script where I could pop in a DVD,
run the script with no special options, and come back a while later
with a burnable DVD-R ISO image. I have found that after a lot of work,
I have something that is almost there. The ISO image almost always
comes out fine, but I at least need to verify the image before I burn
it.</P> 
<P>The first thing the script does is check for cached information
about the DVD, and generates it if it doesn't exist. Then it copies
the titles requested by the user (by 
default all of them) to the vob directory.
The selected titles are transcoded chapter by
chapter and a valid DVD structure is created from the specially
formatted video, and an ISO image is created. If something goes wrong
at any step of the process the script exits cleanly and you can
recover from that point after you fix the problem so that no time is
lost. Two logs are produced, one for the commands and thier output,
and one to chronicle general progress.</P>
<P>If the user has selected to split the DVD (using the -s option) the 
titles are copied directly and an image is created as long as at
least one title will fit. When splitting the options -f, -a, -b, -z, 
and -v options are ignored. The -x option causes the script to create
a duplicate of the source DVD which is a good idea only if you know
the source DVD is in DVD-5 format. When duplicating most options are
ignored.</P>
<P>There are some problems of course, especially with the transcoding
process. I think the biggest problem is that it takes a lot of time
and HD space. On my (PIII 866) system it takes about 20 hours to
transcode a typical movie, as well as 20 Gigs of HD space. There are
some options, defined below, that will reduce that to about 10 Gigs,
but then you can't recover if something goes wrong. The other big
problem is that occasionally the A/V sync for individual chapters is
off. So when I have to transcode a DVD I preview each chapter and
verify the sync is good before I burn a coaster. If the sync is off
then I either delete the offending output vob file(s) in the out directory and rerun the
script with a fudge factor or else (especially for the extra content)
rerun the script with the -t option to skip the offending titles. If I
am really feeling adventurous I use -- to override the transcoding
options. Finally, when transocding you are currently limitied to one
audio and one video rack, and no subtitles.</P>
<P>There are three major issues that aren't related to transcoding. One
is that that there is no support for menus. The second is that to use
this script to split a DVD by chapter instead of title you need to run
it once (using -k would be a good idea here), edit the info.dvd file
to include a bogus new title, and rename some files in the vob
directory. The first problem really doesn't bother me, and the need
for splitting up a DVD by chapter occurs so infrequently for me that
it is not worth my time to do anything about it. The final and most
severe problem is that I have been unable to get both dvdbackup and
tccat to reliably split a DVD up by title or chapter. <STRONG>If you
know of any other Linux programs that do this PLEASE let me
know.</STRONG> dvdbackup occasionally results in missing or extra video
in the middle of a chapter, while tccat either results in unusable
streams (-T), or wants to give me the whole titleset (-P). Until this
problem is resolved I can not reccommend using the -p option.</P>

<H3>Options</H3>
<P>I rarely use any options other than -t, -v, and -c. Some example usages are:</P><UL>
<LI>"dvd2iso.pl -x" - Duplicate a known DVD-5 format DVD.</LI>
<LI>"dvd2iso.pl -pt 3,7,2" - Make a new image by extracting titles 3,
7, and 2 (in that order) from the source DVD.</LI>
<LI>"dvd2iso.pl -c" - Process a new DVD and don't ask me any
questions. If the source DVD is DVD-5 it will be duplicated, otherwise
it will be transcoded.</LI>
<LI>"dvd2iso.pl -kf 800" - Fix a A/V sync problem with one or more
output VOB files. 800 is just a guess. :-)</LI>
<LI>"dvd2iso.pl -D" - Transcodes using the absolute minimum HD space.</LI>

<H3>Internals</H3>
<P>The following are examples of typical commands executed on your
behalf by the script. And no, I don't know what all the transcode
options mean, but it seems to work. Many of the values for the options shown below
are dynamic and may change from DVD to DVD. </P><UL>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>So far I am very happy with this script and don't plan on 
making any more major modifications. I
can run this script with no human intervention, almost always
resulting in a good backup. If you have any ideas on how to fix the
occasional sync issues please let me know. I now personally use
vobcopy to duplicate DVD-5 DVD's since it appears much more stable.</P>
<P>Be warned 
that if you use this code on copyrighted content then your government
probably considers you a dirty, rotten, stinking, hellbound pirate, and (especially in
the USA) you could face fines, confiscation of your computer(s) and/or
imprisonment! This heinous crime is MUCH worse than ripping the tag
off of your mattress, so if you get thrown in the pokey for using something
you own, in private, strictly for your personal 
use, then it is your own damn fault.
