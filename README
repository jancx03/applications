= Generic Applications (Home) Folder =

This is a generic set of tools and configuration files
for all accounts on all UNIX systems.

It was written from the ground up to work well with all 
shells on all UNIX OSes known, including but not limited to:

  * Linux
  * MacOS X
  * FreeBSD/*BSD
  * CygWin

To use this scripts, just copy this folder to ~/Applications 
and make some simple setup steps:

  cd ~/
  ln -s Applications/share/shell/bashrc .bashrc
  ln -s Applications/share/shell/bash_profile .bash_profile
  ln -s Applications/share/shell/dir_colors .dir_colors
  ln -s Applications/share/shell/inputrc .inputrc

(there are other sample files in Applications/share/shell/ 
that you might want to copy or symlink)

You might want to use other share items like vim and mutt files:

  cd ~/
  ln -s Applications/share/vim .vim
  ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
  ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc
  ln -s Applications/share/mutt .mutt

All changes needed to modify your environment should be done 
on local files. For instance, to modify your bashrc settings:

  touch ~/.bashrc-`hostname`

And add your changes to this new .bashrc-`hostname` file.

The same applies to vimrc, muttrc and other main configuration files.

There is a command called "update-host" that pulls changes 
from the main repository on my own website: http://lems.kiskeyix.org

  update-host --master

 * --master means: gets changes from master server

The actual files are saved to:

    ~/Shared/Software/settings/Applications.tar.bz2

That means that you can now use update-host to push your changes 
to local computers with:

  update-host [--send-key] system1.example.com system2.example.com system{3..10}.example.com

NOTE: --send-key is optional and it should be used only once.
It sends your public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on 
the remote host.

And you will see as the script attempts to send the local files to 
each system via SSH (using ssh-agent to keep the session open so you 
are not prompted for passwords/passphrases).

If you make changes to Applications and you want these to be sent to 
remote systems instead of the tarball from --master, you can do:

  update-host --local server1 server2 ... serverN

Ideas patches and the like, should be submitted to myself at:

able to type the address correctly)
